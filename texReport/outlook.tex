The \texttt{DMPcreator} covers just a small fraction of the aspects of a data management plan. Therefore, it could be extended by adding more user slides concerning data security and data sharing for example. Furthermore, the .tsv file could be parsed more detailed. It also contains information about the experiment structure, the treatment of the individuals and the tissues, which are not yet used by generating the data management plan. 


Moreover, additional fields for user input could be added. This provides the user the possibility to create a more specific and adapted data management plan.
