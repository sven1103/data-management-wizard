\section{Experimental Design Knowledge}
On of the project's task was the implementation of results from an web-based experimental design tool called QWizard \cite{1}. It is part of QBiC's web-based science gateway QPortal which handles scientific experimental projects and data. Customers are using the QWizard for setting up their experimental design and therefore provide information which already can be used for the data management plan.
